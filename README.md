# Terminal Game

A command-driven game that runs in the browser. Type exploits into a 
terminal, attack a target, drain their HP, manage your energy.

## Commands
- `attack` — launch an exploit against the target
- `start` — start a new game
- `clear` — clear the terminal

## What's Built So Far
- Player and target objects storing all game state
- Real-time terminal output on every action
- Energy system — attacks cost energy
- Live status updates showing HP and energy after each action
- Command-based input handling

## What I Learned
- Modeling game state with JavaScript objects
- Writing functions that call other functions
- Connecting JavaScript to the DOM
- Responding to user input with event listeners

## Stack
Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS. No frameworks, no libraries, no tutorials.

## Status
Day 2 of active development. Enemy counterattack coming next.
